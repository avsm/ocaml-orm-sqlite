Known issues and TODO list before a 1.0 release. Until then, the 
ORM is a work-in-progress and anything is subject to change dramatically!

Issues:
-------

- ORM:
   * no type-conv signature generator yet
   * handle type t = { x : M.t }
   * handle type 'a t = { x : 'a }

Interface changes:
-----------------

- Add a x_fold function to match the x_get function

- Sqlite CONSTRAINT errors for uniqueness violations (e.g. on a unique
  indexed field) need to be exposed better than just throwing up the 
  CONSTRAINT error which is really hard to track down.

Optimization:
------------

- Bind sqlite3_profile to make that information available.

Nice to have:
------------

- A field name of "id" in a record will cause an error; type
  checker should reject these or rewrite them into something different.

- Warn on reserved keywords in types (id, from) which are not
  valid SQL field names (or transform them to be safe).

- Add foreign key constraints for sanity checking in debug mode.
  Not strictly needed, but an additional integrity check

- Generate smart ocamldoc; not sure if this is possible with camlp4
  extensions without a custom doc generator.
